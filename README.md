# Clustering Assignment

This repository contains a comparative performance study of different clustering algorithms using various pre-processing techniques and evaluating them on different parameters. The analysis is conducted on three datasets: "mice," "ipl," and "elections," sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The clustering algorithms employed include K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN.

## Contents

- **Notebook:** The main analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook named `Clustering_Assignment.ipynb`. This notebook is implemented in Google Colab for easy accessibility and reproducibility.

- **Datasets:** The datasets used in this assignment are "mice," "ipl," and "elections." The datasets are loaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- **Results:** The results, including tables, graphs, and conclusions, are provided within the notebook. The evaluation parameters include cluster silhouette scores, intra-cluster distance, and other relevant metrics.

## Usage

1. Open the `Clustering_Assignment.ipynb` notebook using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

2. Follow the step-by-step analysis, including loading datasets, applying clustering algorithms, and evaluating their performance.

3. View the tables and graphs illustrating the comparative study of different clustering algorithms with various pre-processing techniques.

4. Conclude the findings based on the evaluation metrics and insights gained from the analysis.
